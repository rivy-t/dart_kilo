[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Dart-blue.svg)](https://dart.dev)

An initial attempt at a Dart port of the [Kilo text editor][kilo]. Primarily
built as a test harness for the [`dart_console`][dart_console] package, which
is itself at an early stage of development.

## Current status (Aug 27th, 2019)

Basic text viewing, editing and searching capabilities.

```bash
dart pub get # install dependencies (when needed; only required for 1st run)
dart kilo.dart testfile
```

- Can load an existing file, make changes and save it.
- Can create a new file, save it and be prompted for a filename.
- Arrow keys, page up/down, home/end should all work.
- Vertical and horizontal scrolling should work.
- Status bar should show accurate information.
- Can do forwards or backwards incremental search.

## About the source project

Notes from the Kilo project:

> Kilo does not depend on any library (not even curses). It uses fairly
> standard VT100 (and similar terminals) escape sequences. The project is in
> [an] alpha stage and was written in just a few hours...
>
> People are encouraged to use it as a starting point to write other editors
> or command line interfaces that are more advanced than the usual REPL style
> CLI.

Thanks also to snaptoken, for their instruction tutorial which breaks Kilo
down into a [multi-step tutorial][snaptoken]. Lots of fun here!
